# inventory-web-app
Welcome to my Inventory Web App!

If your coming from the repository, just import the whole repository into replit.com and press the 'Run' button to start up the web app.

Otherwise, feel free to play around with the web app. This project was created for Shopify's Internship Coding Challenge. Authentication and CSS/Design was not required/considered during evaluation, hence the lack of aesthetics.

Note: Hopefully, you don't run into the "ALLOWED_HOSTS" error on replit.com, but if you do simply fork the replit and add the host to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS list` in the `inventory_web_app/settings.py` file.
